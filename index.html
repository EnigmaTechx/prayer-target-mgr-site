          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            Prayer Target Manager, or PT MGR for short, is an online tool to
            help keep the average Christian keep track of their prayer life.
            According to Matthew 26:41, Jesus spent at least one hour praying
            for the will of God when He was about to be crucified. As people who
            claim to follow Christ, praying for at least one hour is an
            excellent standard to follow for any situation in our lives. We must
            also use scriptures to back our prayer topics because the Word of
            God says, "anything ye shall ask in my name, the Father may give it
            to you"
            <cite>(John 15:16)</cite>. We believe Jesus is the living Word of
            God, so it is wise to use the Word when making requests to God
            Almighty.
          </p>
          <p>
            This productivity tool helps you create prayer topics, set goals
            i.e., number of hours you want to pray, and lets you record new
            hours you pray towards your goal. Give it a try.
